    js
        page loads, game starts, user asked to press any key.

        .addEventListener for keyup, runs game function, all game logic within these initial curly braces; this cannot register as a guess!

        computer randomly chooses word from list of words, word length generated, guesses reset - 15?, letters already guessed reset - empty.

        if/else for guesses.

        if guesses match: letter appears (display none? no, simply write to div).

        if guesses do no match: letter guessed appears in Letters Already Guessed, Number of Guesses decreases by 1.

        if all guesses match, Congratulations message is shown, user is asked if they want to play again. 



randomly selected word:
draft1
list of words can be string, array or object?

computer randomly chooses number (some sort of math function from 3.2??) which corresponds to word, then using .length for Current Word.

randomly selected word pushed to "active array"? letters of word broken into indices? (PROBLEM!)

problem 1: how do I take the word, count the number of letters, and create a gameboard based on that count??

    solution1: take .length, insert 1 underscore for the length, change gameboard div 

select random word from list
var computerChoice = wordList[Math.floor(Math.random() * wordList.length)];

length of randomly selected word (number) stored in variable
var gameboardLength = computerChoice.length

problem 2: how do I take that number and create a gameboard? ie create underscore for each letter?

    solution 1: for loop!

problem 3: how do I code different actions for multiple/concurrent key presses? ie first keypress starts game, second keypress counts as letter guess, etc

I need a way to differentiate between key presses!

    solution1: wrapping with if/else? perhaps with a counter? failed

    solution 2: for loop? started but revisited if/else, this time using if/else inside of document.addEventListener - successful, but doesn't make sense to implement, seems like it would be way to lengthy, would need one if/else argument for EACH user key press, no way of knowing how many key presses the user will make... wait, user will make at least 16 key presses (1 to start + 15 guesses)

    solution 3: functions

    solution 4: timestamp? 

    solution 5: use start button

problem 4:how to handle guesses?

    solution1:take randomly chosen word, break up each letter and add to array, then use .indexof to check if guess match anything in array

problem 5: how do I handle keypresses that match? how do I take a keypress that matched a letter in the randomly chosen word and add that to the Current Word div; on top of that, how do I add that letter to the right position in that set of underscores? ie keypress matched letter that corresponds to third underscore, how I replace that third underscore with the letter that was pressed?

    solution 1: take userGuess (key user pressed), look inside of computerChoice (computer's randomly chosen word), get index of that letter, then store value (int) in var.
var gameboardIndex = computerChoice.indexOf(userGuess);

problem 6: now I have the index, how do I change the correct underscore in the Current Word div?  I need to go into .gameboard with my index, and change the matching index in .gameboard div

    solution 1: couldn't I just recreate the entire div after each correct keypress? success!

problem 7: gameboard recreate after matching keypress (correct guess), wasn't registering the last character. js was recognizing the last matching keypress, but it wasn't adding it to the Current Word div.

    solution 1: document.querySelector(".gameboard").innerHTML = gameboard was inside the else argument, meaning that the correct guess was going through the if argument and it was adding it to the gameboard, but since it was never entering the else argument, it was never being written to the div element. moved document... outside of else, inside of for loop. 

problem 8: able to match keypress to change right underscore in Current Word div, however, it is recreating the div after each keypress, ie it deletes any previous keypresses and recreates with the current keypress. How do I get the previous keypresses to stick?

    solution 1: store gameboardIndex into array, then when rebuilding gameboard, use index in that array. in progress....

    solution 2: modify for loop that rebuilds gameboard with userGuess - trying with "gameboard[i] = userGuess;"

problem 8.1 : when console.log(gameboard[i], computerChoice[i] and userGuess), all three should be identical, but gameboard[i] is still showing underscore instead of userGuess. how to make it show userGuess??

    solution 1: figured out I was declaring gameboard as a string, and strings are immutable, ie not mutable, ie not writable nor configurable (cannot change them), and because I was using the bracket character access method, ie gameboard[i], it was not working. switched gameboard to array, then used .push() to build empty (underscores)  gameboard, then .join() to eliminate the commas in between. -solved!


problem 9: if word has the same letter repeating elsewhere in the string - eg javascript has "a" at index 1 and 3 - computerChoice.indexOf(userGuess); is only recognizing the first instance, it stops searching once it reaches the first find. how do I get it to continue its search?

    solution: if/else (?) using the options of indexOf (?) so that its search starts at or after the first found character. found it! "str.indexOf(searchValue[, fromIndex])" need to use fromIndex option!

problem 10: how to incorporate fromIndex? where do I add it?

    solution: at if (computerChoice.split("").indexOf(userGuess) !== -1 )... if it matches? is that the only match? fromIndex = gameboardIndex, then begin search from there. -success!

problem 11: how do I take var gameboardFromIndex and incorporate into 2nd for loop, which rebuilds gameboard with correct guesses? same or similar issue as problem8.

    solution: see problem 8.1 -solved!



    ON DECK!




problem 12: need to fix letters guessed. it is only recording the current guess, not any previous guesses. 

    solution 1: store guesses into string/array then push to p.letters-guessed. was already doing this, but was pushing userGuess to .innetHTML instead of lettersGuessed string. -solved!

problem 12.1: there is no spacing in p.letters-guessed.

    solution 1: instead of string, perhaps array? solved, but need spacing in between comma and letter. solved with: " " + userGuess. -solved!

problem 12.1.1: letters guess is repeating the letter, should only be one instance. 

    solution 1: pushed userGuess to array, used function-for loop to check if userGuess was already in array, if it wasn't then it was added to new array, new array then pushed to p.letters-guessed. -solved!



problem 13: need to fix wins. currently not logging wins

    solution 1: string or array and counter?

problem 14: need to fix theme. currently static, need to get it to change based on computerChoice. Hangman title should change to match browser color scheme (also need to change wordList to browsers) ie yellow/red/blue/green if computerChoice chrome

    solution 1: ??? google how to change css with javascript?

problem 15: need some sort of congratulatory message upon guessing word; tied to problem 13.

    solution 1: if/else that checks if gameboard is letters or underscores?

problem 16: need to fix guesses remaining, should not countdown if letter has already been guessed; tied to problem 12. 

    solution 1: store letters already guessed in array, check if they are already in array, if so don't countdown, if not, then countdown. already have array from p12.1.1-s1. if user guess is already in uniqueGuesses, then don't count down.
