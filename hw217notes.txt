js
page loads, game starts, user asked to press any key.

.addEventListener for keyup, runs game function, all game logic within these initial curly braces; this cannot register as a guess!

computer randomly chooses word from list of words, word length generated, guesses reset - 15?, letters already guessed reset - empty.

list of words can be array or object?

computer randomly chooses number (some sort of math function from 3.2??) which corresponds to word, then using .length for Current Word.

if/else for guesses.

randomly selected word pushed to "active array"? letters of word broken into indices? (PROBLEM! how to solve??)

if guesses match: letter appears (display none? no, simply write to div).

if guesses do no match: letter guessed appears in Letters Already Guessed, Number of Guesses decreases by 1.

if all guesses match, Congratulations message is shown, user is asked if they want to play again.
